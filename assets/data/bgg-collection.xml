	<numplays>7</numplays>			<comment>A lot of fun, very engaging, fantastic artwork and a captivating theme, the tension is palpable as the situation escalates. The first cooperative game in my collection, and I don&#039;t feel a need to rush out and buy another coop game any time soon. I&#039;d consider giving this a 9 (my initial score: 8.5) but I&#039;ll wait and see how I feel after a few more solo and group plays. The packaging is also worth mentioning, very compact and stylish.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>3</numplays>			<comment>I can never seem to draw the tiles I need to complete my city (or to stop another player from claiming it), but that never deters me from playing it. I find it just as much fun no matter how many players (well, 2-4, I&#039;ve never played with 5) and it&#039;s a nice balance between simplicity and strategy.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>2</numplays>			<comment>This really gives the creative side of your brain a heavy workout! The cards are beautifully detailed, intricate, and open to many interpretations. It&#039;s incredible when you&#039;ve had a card in your hand for several turns without any idea of how you could play it, only to see it become a perfect fit for another player&#039;s turn. Likewise when you see another player interpret cards in a different way to you. It requires a certain amount of energy or spark, but I&#039;m yet to play this with a group that hasn&#039;t enjoyed it. Sometimes it can take a while for the active player to take their turn, and if this occurs frequently we tend to allow other players to step in and take their turn instead, which keeps the game flowing and doesn&#039;t affect the game balance.</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>6</numplays>			<comment>A brilliant, elegant 2-player game that&#039;s somehow strategic without being stressful. This is our go-to lightweight game. The only downside is storage, which drove me to make my first foamcore insert (which turned out great). Definitely a favourite!</comment>				<wishlistcomment>This looks like a great 2-player game (see, e.g., https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/5nci4k/everything_you_ever_wanted_to_know_about_board/dcglkgk/)</wishlistcomment></item>

	<numplays>0</numplays>			<comment>Used to play this a lot as a child, I still find it sufficiently fun and challenging that I&#039;ll readily give it a play (unless I&#039;m tired and don&#039;t have the patience for picking up terrible letters). Perhaps the biggest frustration is playing against people who use each turn for maximum (immediate) gain and subsequently render large portions of the board inaccessible. And, depending on how serious everyone is, it&#039;s probably worth having a good (i.e., large) dictionary on hand!</comment>				</item>

	<numplays>6</numplays>			<comment>A lot of fun, we&#039;ve played this with several groups of friends and everyone has enjoyed it. The variety of map layouts and treasure clues allow each game to play out differently, and the production quality is great (particularly the map and the idols). Although it&#039;s quite simple and easy to pick up, there&#039;s also more depth than might appear at first glance (e.g., the order in which clues are played against a given treasure determines the bidding order for the treasure cards, and the amulets scattered across the island can be used in a variety of ways). Highly recommended!</comment>				</item>

I'm terrible at staying in touch with friends and family.
Recent events rarely, if ever, seem to merit firing off an email.
And the more time that passes between each communiqu√©, the greater the
pressure to write something *substantial*.
Online messages have a *cheap and nasty* feel, the electronic equivalent of a
late-night souvlaki, so writing something substantial feels like an uphill
battle.
No wonder my motivation withers to nothing (or so I tell myself).
But a handwritten letter is truly something else, from another time, an other
world.

Letters convey a level of intimacy by sheer virtue of their *existence*, let
alone their contents.
They inspire a desire, an onus, to respond likewise.
They renew calluses I thought I'd never see again after my school days.
Rummaging through old letters is a warm and fuzzy experience, one which no
amount of searching old emails can begin to approach.

An email costs nothing to send, physically or financially, and their sheer
volume and general triviality means that they become a form of *clutter*.
Meanwhile, reading even a few biographies of historical figures reveals the
amazing depth and value of posthumous letter collections.
Once the *de facto* means of communicating with people beyond the immediate
household, they provide all manner of insights into a person's life, many of
which simply have *no parallel* in our online communications.

They
are [treasures](http://thewritepractice.com/value-of-a-hand-written-letter/)
of immense value.

In this day and age, with the vast array of conveniences we have at hand, a
handwritten letter truly is a labour of love.
They tell such wonderful, human stories.
I love that we have friends with whom this is a primary form of communication.
I'm also grateful that these friends are few in number; there's only so much
toil my hand can take.

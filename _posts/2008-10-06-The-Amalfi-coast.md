Hello everyone!

My final two days in Italy were spent based in Salerno, on the eastern end of
the Amalfi coast, south of Naples.
On the first day, we visited the excavated remains of the ancient Greco-Roman
village at Paestum, founded in the seventh century BC and now a UNESCO world
heritage site.
The majority of the village has not been excavated, as there is a small town
on top of the remains --- in fact, remains were uncovered when building the
town's main road.
The construction continued on, destroying what little of the ancient town was
uncovered, leading to a criminal case against the manager of the project.

It was nice to walk along the excavated streets and see the layout of the
individual rooms and buildings in the town, as well as the original street
paving stones, which still carried the worn cart-tracks from ancient times.

There were also the standing remains of three temples (thankfully the last
temples I saw in Italy, as I was starting to suffer from temple-fatigue), of
which the Temple of Hera was amazingly complete, much more so than any other
temple I have seen.
This temple was so impressive that the neighbouring temple, which would have
been quite grand on its own, suffered in comparison and was sarcastically
waved off as "just another temple".

The plan for my final day in Italy was to head along the Amalfi coast
to Positano --- reputedly the most beautiful of the many small towns situated
along this stretch of coast --- and finally enjoy the beach day that the
Italian weather had so far conspired to prevent.
The plan was foiled at the very first step, as the bus timetable only allowed
us to travel as far as the town of Amalfi, since we had to get to Rome airport
by late evening.
However, all was not lost!
The 90 minute bus ride along the Amalfi coast was worth the ticket price
solely for the wonderful views of the small towns and many vineyards perched
precariously on the steep coastal cliffs, and the town itself turned out to be
very nice, with many interesting side-streets and twisting passages that were
thankfully free of tourists.
And in possibly the biggest stroke of luck yet, the sky was clear and the sun
was shining brightly, allowing us to finally swim in the Mediterranean!
At this point, the day was officially a success, and we managed to have some
very good pizzas at a secluded restaurant before returning to Salerno.

It is worth mentioning that the road along the coast was only just wide enough
for two cars, and on the frequent occasion that two buses attempted to pass
each other, we witnessed the most amazing precision driving, as full-size tour
buses manoeuvred with mere centimetres of clearance on either side.
At times it was disconcerting to sit on the ocean side of the bus, as the bus
sometimes appeared to be hanging over the edge of the road, with a very long,
steep and rocky descent to the water below.
Thankfully all disasters were avoided, and we were able to board the train
back to Rome.
All I want to say about my final night in Rome is that the Leonardo da Vinci
airport is not the best airport in the world to sleep in.
Not even close.
In the morning, I boarded my flight to Reykjavik and said goodbye to Italy.

I hope you are all well!

It's been 72 days since flight SQ334 touched down at Charles de Gaulle airport
and stranded me in a land of francophones.
And while there have already been many adventures, I haven't yet found the
time to document them.
Nor have I finished writing about my previous European sojourn.
All in good time, I tell myself.
All in good time.

Last month, while visiting friends and family in Canada, we discovered that
Edmonton has a [French Quarter](http://www.frenchquarteredmonton.ca/).
*Ça m'a surpris !*
Especially since there doesn't appear to be an equivalent neighbourhood in
Calgary.
We only paid it a cursory visit, long enough to enjoy a relaxed lunch in *la
cité francophone*, but not sufficient for the French-speaking part of my brain
to get out of first gear.
However, last week we said goodbye to a French colleague who is returning to
France to take up a permanent position, and despite some stumbles I was able
to hold most of a conversation in French.
So I just need some time to get back in the groove.
*Quel soulagement !*

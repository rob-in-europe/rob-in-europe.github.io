It's been a great week in Edinburgh.
My talk went well, I did the Scotch Whisky Experience, and a cancelled
Literary Pub Tour turned into a great night!
After spending about 45 minutes sitting in a dark, empty meeting room on the
top floor of the Beehive Inn, waiting for the actors to arrive and the pub
tour to start, it became clear that the tour was not going to happen.
The night took a turn for the better, as I moved on to another pub with two
fantastic (and hilarious!) American ladies who also had tickets for the pub
tour.

After a pint (and a nip of a great 15yo scotch), we ended up taking a
Graveyard Tour of Edinburgh.
To ward off the cold night and the relentless rain, a bottle of "old and
cheap" scotch was purchased and cups were purloined from Starbucks, and
generously filled.
The tour proved to be excellent, despite the rain being sufficient to
completely drench us all.
The night was topped off with a free pint at the Bank Bar, warming ourselves
around some small candles until closing time.
This was followed by a mad dash to our respective hostels, and I was able to
convince the hostel staff to throw my sodden clothing into the dryer.

It's now 10am in Edinburgh, I'm due to check out in 30 minutes, and I'm
heading off to the airport just after noon.
I didn't get to see everything I would have liked to in Edinburgh (nor did I
build up the courage to climb the Walter Scott monument -- although I may if I
can squeeze in a quick few pints in the next hour or so), but it really has
been a great week.
I highly recommend coming here (and that you see a whole lot more of Scotland
than I did).
Bye for now!

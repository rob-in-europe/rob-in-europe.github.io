Summer in Paris has been ... interesting.
The city empties itself of Parisians and replaces them with tourists, both
French and foreign.
This has given me the opportunity to hone my tourist-radar, but to be honest
most of the tourists are far too obvious.

I have been approached on the street and asked questions in English, and
depending on my disposition I either respond in basic French or let loose in
my mother tongue.
This often draws a surprised "oh, you speak English!"
from my inquisitor, which makes me wonder why on earth they began in English,
without even a simple "bonjour" or "parlez-vous anglais?" ... I have not yet
become a rude Parisian (a particular strain of the French I am yet to
encounter), but I can empathise.

Much like the cold, dark winter that brought snowfall to a particularly
unsuitable city, and which inspired many Parisians to tell me that such a
winter was not normal, my first full summer in Paris has been colder, cloudier
and rainier than I had hoped for, or had even expected.
I am repeatedly told that such a summer is not normal, and start to wonder...

But when the sun shines and I'm not at work, Paris is a certainly a lovely
city to explore.
Especially by bicycle.
Some weekends I cycle off in a random direction with a book, a baguette and a
beer, getting myself thoroughly lost before finding a sunny spot to sit and
read.
And there's always something to see or do (although it often helps to be
fluent in French).

One of the spectacles I haven't taken advantage of yet is the "Paris Plages"
(Paris beach), where thousands of tonnes of sand have been shipped in by barge
and dumped on the (closed-for-summer) expressway that runs along the bank of
the Seine.
Call me old fashioned, but I certainly prefer a beach where you can enter the
water (illegal and highly inadvisable for health and safety reasons) and catch
some waves.

I also took the opportunity to watch the final stage of the Tour de France
from a shady street corner.
As you can see, I wasn't the only person to come up with the idea.
In particular, devout fans of Norwegian cyclist Thor Hushovd lent a festive
atmosphere to the proceedings, when lesser fans might have become sedate as
support vehicle after support vehicle passed, with nary a bicycle in view.
Thankfully, we were finally treated to eight laps of hectic, densely packed
cyclical madness.

Even the support vehicles got in on the act, tooting their horns and waving
(especially the medical staff lounging in the back of an open-top sports car).
One of the motorcycles took the corner too fast, tires slipping and squealing,
before regaining control and retaining both occupants.
My inexpert eye was able to spot Cadel Evans in the yellow jersey, although
there was another rider who wore a red/yellow affair, which confused things
somewhat.
And, through sheer blind luck, you can even spot Cadel Evans in the (above?)
photo, wedged between the idle policemen and the proud Norwegian flag.

And my plans for next weekend?
I fly to Knoxville, Tennessee for a three-day workshop on modelling renal
hemodynamics.
But I'd rather skip the hours of dealing with aeroplanes, airports and the
good ol' folks of the TSA, and stay here in Paris.

À bientôt

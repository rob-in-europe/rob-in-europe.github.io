For the first time in six years, I didn't have the time and energy to make a [pumpkin pie]({% post_url 2015-10-12-Pumpkin-pie %}) for Canadian Thanksgiving.
Melbourne has been in stage 3 lockdown since July 8 (*101 days* and counting).
For us, the restrictions have primarily been inconvenient rather than truly disruptive or harmful.
We have few friends within the 5km travel limit, and I'm unable to go to the gym and do rehab exercises, or to let off steam by playing ice hockey.
There are many people in this city for whom the lockdown has been much more serious and damaging.
With daily case numbers remaining low (and possibly decreasing) hopefully we'll hear tomorrow that some restrictions will be eased.
In the meantime, there's still no pumpkin pie ...

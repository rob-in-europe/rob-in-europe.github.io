I've been in Edinburgh for about 24 hours now, and have found it to be a
lovely, quirky town.
24 hours isn't long enough for me to write a reflective essay on my travels
thus far --- and I don't feel a great yearning to reminisce about the near-30
hours I spent on planes to get here --- so this is a pretty brief email.

The hostel (High Street Hostel) is decent, and full of friendly people.
The town is full of picturesque buildings and endless alleyways that weave
between them all sorts of angles.
A free three-hour walking tour of the Old Town was fantastic, and I also
managed to register at the AHM08 conference, after some brief confusion where
the staff repeatedly asked me if I was sure I'd registered.
Mishaps have been avoided thus far.
I have posted [some photos](https://photos.app.goo.gl/xKmrCvv5BypRV9217).

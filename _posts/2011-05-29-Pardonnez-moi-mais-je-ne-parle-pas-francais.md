May 16, 2011, marks a milestone both personal and professional.
For a period of slightly less than thirty minutes, I was reduced to a nervous
wreck the likes of which I have not resembled since my undergraduate days.
The occassion was the [XXXI^(ème) Séminaire de la Société Francophone
de Biologie Théorique](http://sfbt-2011.imag.fr/) (the 31^(st)
Conference of the Francophone Society of Theoretical Biology).
To finish the very first session of talks, I stumbled my way (not completely
awkwardly) through a hastily concieved and poorly rehearsed overview of my
research.

*Entirely* in French.

Apart from some minor errors---*milliard* means billion, not million---and a
problem with the sound-system, the talk went surprisingly smoothly and the
audience was very friendly.
But despite a plea for the questions to be given in English, as a reward for
my linguistic efforts, the discussion soon left me adrift in a sea of French,
and grinning slightly foolishly as my *chef* (boss) responded to the
questions.
This, at least, gave me time to recover from the adrenaline-fuelled pounding
in my chest.
Ultimately, I emerged unscathed and buoyed by the supportive atmosphere.

Several people offered charmingly positive feedback as we broke for the first
intermission of the day, though I cannot say if was offered in honesty or out
of politeness.
Perhaps the most memorable moment was that, as I stood outside in the sun and
nursed a coffee, a friendly Frenchman happily noted that I "spoke English very
well".
I was taken aback at this remark, visibly so, and he grinned before correcting
himself.
"You speak French very well."
Such was my introduction to French humour.

The rest of the conference was notable for the wine (served and consumed at
every lunch, as well as at dinner), for the beautiful surroundings (Autrans is
a small ski-resort in the winter), and for the unending barrage of French to
which I was submitted for 72 straight hours (minus sleep).
The first two somewhat compensated for the third, but I was left in an
almost-vegetative state by the time the final talks had concluded.

I shall end by tempting the ire of the March Hare, who famously advised Alice
to "start at the beginning".
The six hour drive from Paris to Autrans offered me my first chance to drive
in a country where one drives on the right side (this is not, as some people
insist, the *correct* side).
I negotiated the initial difficulty of changing gears with my other hand, and
the continual difficulty of staying within the lane markings when seated on
the left-hand side of the car, all at 130 kph.
But before my stint behind the wheel, we were treated to the unusual sight of
a DeLorean, which lingered in our vicinity for perhaps an hour.
Photos were hastily snapped before this rarity had a chance to disappear from
view.
The Back-to-the-Future vibe was only reinforced the following day when my
*chef* donned a puffy vest, eerily reminiscent of a young Michael J. Fox...

On August 25, 1944, the German garrison surrendered the city of Paris to the
combined forces of the French Resistance, the Free French Army of Liberation,
and the 4th US Infantry division.
*La Libération de Paris* was not the end of the German occupation of France,
and is not a public holiday (*jour férié*) in France, but it just so happens
to commemorate the same date and location as my wedding.
Did I mention I was married?

For a relationship that has been sadly defined, more often than not, by the
vast distances between Ardis and I rather than the closeness we share, our
wedding was so much more than an affirmation and celebration of our love; it
brought together friends and family from around the world, and for two weeks
we explored the neighbourhoods, sights and restaurants of Paris *en masse*.
The camaraderie was invigorating and, at times, overwhelming.

These same bonds proved a heavy burden in the  months prior to our wedding.
Numerous administrative hurdles from three separate governments were strewn in
our way, and for a long it seemed we would be unable to wed.
It's a story I'll happily recount in person and, perhaps, even here at another
time.
For now, be satisfied knowing we eventually managed to pass every bureaucratic
test and could greet each arrival with the news that the marriage would indeed
go ahead.
And that I was kicked out of the Canadian Embassy.

This was my opportunity to finally meet some of Ardis' closest friends,
Athena and Craig, who had flown in from Canada and disembarked in a timely
manner, but at a different terminal from the one at which they'd told us to
expect them.
Meanwhile, [Paul](http://paulfraser.livejournal.com/) had flown from Australia
and was struggling to reconcile the early weekday morning in Paris with his
body's firm insistence that it was late evening.
The two of us made a beeline for the nearest airport bar and settled into a
few pints.
And so, as Athena and Craig realised their mistake and made their way to this
terminal, they found me a little drunk well before noon.
First impressions and all that.

I built on that impression the following day as we strolled around the
*Palais Royal* gardens and along some of the beautiful galleries nearby.
It was a warm and sunny day, mere wisps of cloud in the sky, and an idyllic
setting in which to recover from jet-lag and become acquainted.
We had begun comparing facets of Australian and Canadian culture, discovering
unexpected similarities and differences, when Athena asked my opinion of
curling; I replied that I was stoutly in favour of any sport that taught women
to perform household chores (e.g., sweeping).
Athena and Craig are not only kind enough to still speak with me, they have
even been so generous as to let Ardis and I stay with them in Edmonton.

The days leading up to the wedding sped by.
We lunched and dined with family and friends every day, and I took advantage
of these opportunities to show off my (limited) French repertoire.
We found time between meals to wander around this great city and show off some
of our favourite nooks and crannies.
Time truly does fly when things are going well; all too soon it was the
evening before the wedding, dinner was done, and everyone was heading home.

Ardis spent the night with her parents, and the following morning Athena,
Craig, and I walked over.
Athena went upstairs and helped Ardis prepare for the big day; Craig kept me
company on the streets until this was achieved.
He suggested we have a beer or two---our first meeting clearly still fresh in
his mind---but the nearby stores were closed at this early hour; instead, we
discussed wedding-day nerves and other matters until Athena called us back to
the apartment.

It was time for the tea ceremony.
This required me to kneel down and offer tea to both of Ardis' parents.
As I began to pour the first cup, her father told me in a matter-of-fact tone
that if the father of the bride refuses the tea, then the wedding cannot go
ahead.
His sense of timing was, as ever, impeccable.
I placed my trust in the fact that her parents had flown from Calgary to Paris
and that this would surely be one of the most inconvenient methods
possible---for all concerned---to cancel a wedding.
And so, apparently oblivious to my distress, he drank the tea.

I have heard a number of French people remark that in France, weddings do not
start on time.
I can vouch for that.
Ardis and I arrived at the town hall (*Mairie du 1er*) and were greeted by a
teeming mass of people; surely there were more than the 26 attendees present?
In fact, we were short four people, three of whom needed to be physically
present for the ceremony to occur: our witnesses (*témoins*) and translator
(*traducteur*).
All of whom were French.
Bastien (*Monsieur Traducteur*) was the last to arrive, and between apologies
he insisted that he had *never* been to a wedding that had started on time.
His streak---a self-fulfilling prophecy---remains intact.

And so it was that Ardis and I climbed the "Stairway of Honour" (*l'escalier
d'honneur*) to the wedding hall and realised that, despite our months of
planning, we had *no idea* how the actual ceremony would proceed.
Not that it mattered, the aide spoke English quite well and quietly guided us
through each step.
The reading of the civil marriage code (in French and, thanks to Bastien,
subsequently in English) devotes little time to the spouses and instead
emphasises the responsibilities of parenthood; *les enfants* (*the children*)
were mentioned over and over again.
Our exchange of wedding rings, on the other hand, was so quick that we had to
reenact it for the photographer.

We were then handed the *Livret de famille* (*family book*) which combines the
role of wedding certificate and birth certificates for any future children.
It comes with sufficient pages for **nine** children and, in the words of the
aide, "more pages can be added if needed."
One glance at Ardis confirmed that there would be no need.
Oh, "and if you get divorced, that also goes in this book."
Thanks, we'll keep that in mind.

Since we started late, the town hall was officially closed by the end of the
ceremony, so we owe the staff our gratitude for allowing us to spill out onto
the balcony (which faces the east end of the Louvre) so that Ardis and I could
receive paparazzi treatment at the hands of our friends and family.
When it became clear that the demand for photos would never end, our poor aide
finally prevailed and escorted everyone back inside, downstairs, and out to
the front gate.
More photos were taken.

And now everyone else was free to roam Paris until the wedding dinner; Ardis
and I spent the afternoon under the direction of Wendy, our extremely warm and
gracious wedding photographer.
Despite the dusty wind and our fatigue (having slept little in the preceding
week) Wendy managed to walk us around central Paris and take a fantastic array
of photos.
We then stumbled blearily back to my apartment.

My parents had staked out my apartment from an adjacent cafe, and as
parents-in-law are wont to do, they had spoken to Ardis' parents earlier in
the day.
The morning tea ceremony had been mentioned, and my parents would not pass up
the perverse pleasure of making me kneel, offer them tea, and thank them for
raising me.
All of this was supervised by Ardis' parents, in what little space we could
fashion in my apartment.
My thanks were muttered with reluctant sincerity.
I would later discover that the knife had been twisted further; Ardis' brother
Dominic had readily agreed to photograph the entire affair and had done so
from an angle that hid Ardis behind me, appearing to leave me solo in my
prostrations.
I have vowed that my brothers will be *forced* to submit to the same procedure
should either of them marry.

I believe we actually pushed our parents out of the apartment rather than
letting them tidy up, such was our exhaustion.
Ardis was out cold only moments later, while I was unable to fall asleep but
too tired to function on any meaningful level.
What precious little time we had to ourselves I spent staring blankly at my
laptop, trying unsuccessfully to follow the plot of a television show I know
by heart.
All too soon it was time to wake up (as best we could), change into
traditional Chinese garb, and make our way to the restaurant (*La Rose de
France*) to get everything in order.

When I say "get everything in order", I should point out that the restaurant
staff did all of the hard work.
We divided the bouquet into several cuttings, one for each table.
A passing family decided that this looked pretty and the husband, taking me
for a waiter, approached and asked (in French) about a table.
This caught me by surprise and it took me a second to begin preparing an
answer in French; one of the waiters hurried up and succinctly explained that
the restaurant was closed for a private function, and I had an "ah-ha!" moment
when he said *"privé"*---right, *that's* the French word for "private"!

Our other task was to assign everyone a seat.
For the past month we had scoured the stalls that line the banks of the Seine
for postcards that recalled specific associations with each guest, and wrote a
message on each; these postcards were then placed on the tables, one at every
setting.
It was up to our friends and family to search the tables and find their
postcard.
We left ourselves a tiny table for two, slightly separated from everyone else,
and visited a different table between each course (glasses in hand).

I owe Julien for recommending this restaurant to me; anyone who visited me in
Paris was taken to *La Rose de France* for dinner.
I am not alone in thinking that they outdid themselves for our wedding dinner;
we still reminisce about the duck (*magret de canard*, which I chose almost
every time I ate there).
Poor Ardis saved her favourite dessert for last (*Charlotte au chocolat*) only
to find she had no room left, which rankles her to this day.

As everyone ate and talked, Ardis and I sat back in sheer relief and were
almost struck dumb with the realisation that our only remaining obligation was
to enjoy what we had wrought.
At that moment, a strong wind gusted into Place Dauphine and began lifting
wave after wave of dust into the air, tearing at the awnings of the
restaurants opposite us until they cracked like whips.
Everyone was aghast, and our first thought was that we could not possibly all
squeeze into the tiny interior of the restaurant.
But fate smiled and the wind only barraged the far side of the square, forcing
unlucky diners inside but leaving us free to sit on the street and listen to
two wandering musicians, cello and trumpet fashioning a graceful and impromptu
accompaniment to the evening.

As the evening wound down, *digestifs* were offered; a small glass of a strong
spirit (so much more poetic in French; *l'eau de vie* translates literally as
*water of life*) is said to aid digestion.
I had foolishly told several friends to try *armagnac*, a French spirit
similar to cognac, of which I had become quite fond; thanks to this
recommendation, when it came time to nominate my drink of choice I was told
that all of the armagnac had been served.
With friends like these ...

The *eau de vie* may have fuelled the more boisterous amongst us (Julien,
Karen, Thibault, Mélanie, *je pense à vous!*) and, as the waiters began
clearing tables and informing us that we had reached the hour where, by law,
they could no longer remain open, the chants of *discours!* (speech!) began.
I wasn't the only anglophone who was bemused, since *discours!* and *disco!*
sound quite similar to our *naïve* ears.
Offering our sincere thank-yous to everyone was certainly the lesser of the
two evils; no number of *digestifs* could have convinced me to dance on the
cobblestones, and Ardis would never have joined me in her heels.

And so we trickled out into the Parisian night in different directions,
looking for cabs, the nearest metro, or (like us) happy to stroll home.
Our French rabble-rousers accompanied us on their way to the Pont Neuf metro
and told us about French wedding customs; we thus have it on dubious authority
that whoever catches the wedding bouquet must get married within the
*following year*.
Since there were only two unmarried females present, one of whom was
[James'](http://docmatrix.blogspot.com/) six-week old daughter Adriel,
Thibault was greatly relieved that we had instead divided the bouquet amongst
the tables.
And so Mélanie lamented to the empty streets---in what was possibly her best
English phrase of the night---"Thibault doesn't want to marry me!"; poor
Thibault hastened to clarify "... yet!"

We walked the final blocks alone, arm in arm.
Weary to the core, but so thoroughly content and buoyant, in a way I've never
been before or since.
We find it salubrious to reminisce about this hectic, frantic time.
I dare say we always will.

For all of these reasons, I have no difficulty remembering that the Liberation
of Paris occurred on the 25th of August.

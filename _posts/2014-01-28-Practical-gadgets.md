The Channel 4 series "Gadget Man" sounded interesting.
A show that promises to explore the world of gadget and new technology, with
the entertaining and amusingly awkward Richard Ayoade as host, I was reminded
of the ABC series "Quantum" that I thoroughly enjoyed back in the 90s.
But by trying to pack as many gadgets as possible into each episode, there was
rarely time for more than a fleeting mention of names and prices.
It felt more like promotional material than a series of in-depth reviews, and
many of the gadgets appeared to be high-tech only for the sake of being so.
Few gave the impression of being genuinely useful.

Two items, however, caught my attention for being both simple and practical.
The [BabyKeeper](http://www.mommysentials.com/category_11/The-Babykeeper-.htm)
is a baby carrier with hooked straps that attach to the top of a door, a
convenient device for keeping an infant out of harm's way in the kitchen.
Meanwhile, the [piamo](http://www.piamo-espresso.de/) is a tiny plastic
capsule---about the size of an eggcup---that you fill with ground coffee and
water, and then microwave for 30 seconds, producing a more-than-acceptable
espresso!
Unfortunately, the project didn't appear to receive sufficient crowd-funding,
so it isn't clear whether this will ever become available.

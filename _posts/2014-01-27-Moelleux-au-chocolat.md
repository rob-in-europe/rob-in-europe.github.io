This recipe was brazenly stolen from a table at *Koko Black*, an award-winning
chocolatier in Carlton.
We then discovered that copies of the recipe were freely available at the cash
register.
This recipe is as easy as it is delicious, and it's even more scrumptious when
filled with a [berry
ganache]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2014-01-27-Berry-ganache %}).
Use chocolate containing 85--90% cocoa for a truly rich and dark dessert.
Makes 4 servings.

## Ingredients

- 60 g caster sugar (confectioner's sugar)
- 2 eggs
- 2 yolks (about 40 g of yolk)
- 100 g unsalted butter
- 100 g dark chocolate
- 50 g plain flour, sieved
- Cocoa powder (for dusting)

## Instructions

1. Lightly brush four ramekins (150--200 ml) with softened butter, dust with
   cocoa powder, and refrigerate.
2. Gently mix together the sugar, eggs and yolks with a whisk, being careful
   not to incorporate too much air.
3. Melt the butter and chocolate in a heat-proof bowl over a saucepan of
   simmering water (or in a bain marie).
   When melted, remove from the heat and add the egg mixture, combining
   gently.
4. Gradually fold in the flour, taking care to ensure there are no lumps.
5. Place 100 g of the moelleux mix in each ramekin, cover with cling film and
   allow the mixture to refrigerate for at least two hours.
   This will allow the flour to relax and lost its elasticity, and any
   aeration to settle.
6. Pre-heat oven to 190 Celsius (fan-forced).
7. Remove ramekins from the fridge and place immediately into the oven.
   Bake for 10--13 minutes.
   The dough should be slightly firm and spongy to the touch, with a cake-like
   appearance around the edges and a stickier, saucier appearance in the
   middle.
8. Serve in the ramekins placed on individual plates with vanilla bean ice
   cream or raspberry sorbet.
   If you're feeling brave, turn out the dessert directly onto the plates,
   taking care not to break the moelleux.

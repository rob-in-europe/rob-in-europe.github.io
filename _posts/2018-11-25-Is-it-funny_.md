title: Is it funny?

Given my time spent in North Carolina, and having recently spent a month in
France and a short amount of time on London, I repeatedly ask myself a
question that I cannot answer: "Why do I feel more at home in France than I do
in anglophone countries that are not Australia?".

It's not a joke, it's a tangible feeling that hasn't left me since I stopped
living in France.
And make no mistake, I'm not claiming that I feel an affinity with every
aspect of French culture and society --- there's a lot about the country and
the people that I simply don't understand, or simply aren't aware of (mind
you, I could say the same of my native Australia).
Perhaps it's as simple as the [uncanny
valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley) effect, where something
that's very similar to, but not quite the same as, the intimately familiar
elicits a sense of discomfort.

My recent stay in London has made me consider this rather more carefully, and
I think it's a combination of (a) differences being more evident due to my
native fluency in English and my capacity to draw comparisons; and (b) that
France and Australia speak different languages, thereby eliminating any direct
comparisons of pronunciation or vocabulary (the British Airways pilot on my
most recent flight had a thick accent and spoke quickly enough that I
struggled to understand some of what he said).

But I still feel a greater affinity with my French friends than people I've
encountered in the UK and the USA.
Maybe I just lucked out in meeting the right people in France?

Simple to make, delicious and with multiple uses.
Feel free to use whichever berries are currently in season; raspberry,
blueberry and blackberry are particularly delicious.
Our most common use for the ganache is as a filling for the [moelleux au
chocolat]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2014-01-27-Moelleux-au-chocolat %}),
but it can also be mixed into hot chocolates and used in other baking recipes.

## Ingredients

- 125 g berries
- 100 g dark chocolate
- 30 g cream

## Instructions

1. Melt the chocolate in a heat-proof bowl over a saucepan of simmering water.
2. Press the berries through a fine sieve to extract the juice (about 100 g).
3. Gently heat the juice and mix in the cream.
4. Combine the melted chocolate with the berry mixture, taking care not to
   incorporate any air.
5. Pour the ganache into an ice cube tray and freeze.

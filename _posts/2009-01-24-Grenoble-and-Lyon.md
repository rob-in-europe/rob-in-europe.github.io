My visit to Grenoble proved to be very relaxing and invigorating.
I stayed with Garry, Gisela, Georgina, Thea and Siv in a trilingual household
(French, Swedish and English) at a small distance from the town itself.
Despite the insistence of most, if not all, of the family members that
Grenoble was perhaps not the most interesting or prettiest city in France, it
exuded a certain charm of its own, wedged between two large mountain ranges
(at least, they seemed large to me, although they were not deemed impressive
by the locals).
One of the pleasures of my prolonged break from hostel accommodation was to
arise shortly before noon and enjoy a breakfast that included beautiful views
of the snow-capped mountains, which appeared to be so very close.

Grenoble is home to possibly the most unusual sight I've visited in my trip so
far: a nuclear reactor used for scientific research.
While a nuclear reactor seem quite an ordinary place to physicists, I was
quite excited to see what it looked like and I wasn't disappointed.
Much like a spaceship, the plumbing is external and visible, recalling a
passage by Douglas Adams concerning airports, where "the plumbing was exposed
on the grounds that it was functional, and the boarding gates were hidden on
the grounds that they were not."
The abundance of bright-yellow fences and machines reminded me of Half-Life 1,
but there was no resonance cascade or face-hugging aliens.
Unfortunately I forgot to bring my camera and although it is forbidden to take
photos inside the reactor, I wish I had taken photos of the airlock and
contamination detectors at the reactor entrance.
As luck would have it, when Garry and I went to leave the reactor I was not
contaminated and I was allowed to exit.

Apart from the reactor, Grenoble is also home to an amazingly long stretch of
pizzerias that peer over one edge of the river that runs through town.
The word on the street is that they are merely fronts for organised crime,
which is entirely believable as the sheer number of pizzerias would seem to be
unsustainable.
Above the pizzerias, a cable car leads to an old fortress perched above the
town.
In all likelihood the fortress provides scenic views across town to the
opposing mountain range, but I did not feel impelled to find out.

A much better view of Grenoble and the surrounding mountains was to be found
at the top of one of the many surrounding mountains, such as Chamrousse.
The journey to this peak weaves through a number of small French villages,
clean and bright in their dazzling coats of snow.
Taking a slight detour into the countryside, we arrived at a large and
elegant chalet overlooking expansive snow-covered gardens, set against the
rising foothills.
This chalet is where the revolution was first conceived, and it is now home to
the "Musee de la Revolution Francaise" (Museum of the French Revolution),
which I did not enter.

Looking up from the gardens to the towering mountains above, it was clear that
they would provide an exceptional view of both Grenoble and the mountains that
encircle it.
The view from Chamrousse did not disappoint, with a spectacular panorama of
the tiered mountain ranges that don't merely surround Grenoble, but almost
threaten to swallow it entirely.
As the sun began to sink behind one of the countless peaks, the sky became an
illustration of pastel shades, from soft pinks and purples to glittering
oranges and golden yellows --- a stunning palette that is not visible from the
town itself, as the mountain ranges rise too steeply.

In addition to providing fantastic views, these mountain peaks are also ideal
for all manner of snow sports.
For only the second time in my life, and for the first time in about 10
years, I took to the slopes with a snowboard.
Despite the best efforts of Georgina, Thea and Garry, the morning was spent
busily falling and sliding down the slopes on my torso rather than my board.
As a result of one of my many falls, I slid face-first across the snow and
grazed my cheek, giving me the appearance of having been involved in a bar
fight.
But by the afternoon I had grasped the fundamentals and was able to gently
weave my way down the piste.
It was an exhausting and fantastic time, and at the end of the day it was such
a pleasure to have a hot chocolate mixed with Chartreuse at one of the many
bars at the bottom of the ski runs.
I didn't emerge completely unscathed, however, as later that evening my right
foot was unable to bear any weight and I was reduced to painfully hobbling
around on one foot, much to the amusement of everyone.
Thankfully a good night's sleep was a sufficient remedy.

It was a quiet pleasure to reside (if only briefly) in such a busy, friendly
and accommodating household.
The closer I approached my impending return to hostel accommodation, the
stronger I felt such appreciation for what could be called an ordinary family
life.
I am deeply indebted to the entire McIntyre family for their hospitality,
their generosity and their company.
Unfortunately, all too soon it was time to leave Grenoble and return to Nancy
and the Vosges for Christmas.

I returned to the north via Lyon, where I spent most of the day wandering
around town, admiring both the beautiful painted facades adorning so many of
the buildings, and the many narrow tunnels and passageways used by the French
resistance.
Clearly visible on the skyline, a brilliant white church sits atop the
tallest hill and looks out across the town, providing panoramic views that
were admired by a surprisingly large crowd of both tourists and locals.
And as the friendly lady at the tourist office informed me, Lyon is also home
to a renowned astronomical clock --- this was the first such clock I have seen
during my journey and it did not disappoint.
In this age of software and advanced electronics it is quite astonishing to
see a mechanical system accurately track the paths of the constellations
across the sky, and the clock is also spectacular, being quite ornate and
intricate in appearance.
As the sun descended behind the beautifully painted buildings, it was time to
leave.
I did regret not having more time to spend in Lyon, but I was also excited to
return to Nancy and head to the Vosges for Christmas.

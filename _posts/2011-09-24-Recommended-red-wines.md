I am no wine connoisseur.
On the rare occasion that I buy a bottle of wine, I've followed the advice
(given to me by many people here in Paris) that anything at or above 5€ is
probably fine.
But what do you do if you're buying wine as a gift for someone with a more
refined palate than mine?
It is common knowledge that price is not always an indicator of quality
(although sub-3€ bottles are distinctive).
If price is no problem at all, you could hunt down a bottle of
[Pétrus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C3%A9trus_%28wine%29) or
[Romanée-Conti](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman%C3%A9e-Conti).
As a mere mortal, I decided to ask for some recommendations and received the
following list (in no particular order):

- Mercurey (Bourgogne) 2006, 2007;
- Châteauneuf-du-Pape (Côtes du Rhône) 2004;
- Savigny-lès-Beaune (Burgundy) 2006; and
- Bourgueil (Indre-et-Loire) 2008.

As a general guide, you should be able to find these wines for 20--30€.

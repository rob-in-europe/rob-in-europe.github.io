## Overview
[subject] **[imperfect conjugation]**

The imperfect conjugation is formed by dropping the -ons from the **first
person plural of the present tense** (ie, nous parl-ons, nous finiss-ons, nous
attend-ons) and added the appropriate ending:

- je: -ais
- tu: -ais
- il/elle: ait
- nous: ions
- vous: iez
- ils/elles: aient

**Notes:**

- All of the singular forms and the third person plural are *pronounced
  alike*.
- The first and second person plurals are the same as in the present tense,
  except for the leading 'i'.
- The only irregular verb in the imperfect tense is être, which uses the stem
  **ét-** for (regular) conjugation.

## Verbs conjugated irregularly in the present tense

Since the imperfect conjugation is formed from the **first person plural**,
verbs that conjugate irregularly in the present tense will have regular
imperfect conjugations, but with *imperfect stems*.

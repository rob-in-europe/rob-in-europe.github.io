<p>
After submitting my PhD thesis I wandered around Europe for six months (way
back in 2008&ndash;2009).
I spent two years working in Paris and learning French (2010&ndash;2012) then
two years in Durham, North Carolina (2012&ndash;2014) before returning home.

And I'm way behind in writing about <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/travel">my
travels</a> and other significant life events.

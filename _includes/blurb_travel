<p>
After submitting my PhD thesis I wandered around Europe for six months (way
back in
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/travel/tag/#Europe%2008/09">2008&ndash;2009</a>).
I spent two years working in Paris and learning French
(<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/travel/tag/#Paris">2010&ndash;2012</a>) then
two years in Durham, North Carolina (2012&ndash;2014) before returning home.

And I'm way behind in writing about my travels and other significant life
events.
